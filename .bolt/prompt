Context: The user is experiencing issues with their Netlify setup. Specifically, the Netlify Visual Editor is not working, and deployments are failing due to a problem with the dist directory.

Goal: Provide a solution that enables both the Netlify Visual Editor and successful Netlify deployments.

Key Requirements (User's Words):

"We need to be absolutely clear about the requirements for this project. We *must* have the Netlify Visual Editor working correctly."

"The Netlify Visual Editor's functionality is *dependent* on a StackBlitz-like environment. This is *not* optional. We cannot remove Stackbit or any component that provides the functionality that StackBlitz provides for the Netlify Visual Editor."

"The core problem we are facing is twofold:

Netlify Visual Editor Dependency: The Netlify Visual Editor requires a working StackBlitz-like environment to function. This allows content editing and previewing. We believe our Stackbit configuration is intended to provide this.

`dist` Directory Issue: Our Netlify deployments are failing because the `dist` directory does not contain the correct, built website files. This is a Vite configuration issue. Netlify needs the correct website files in the `dist` directory to deploy the site."

"Therefore, the solution *must* address both of these requirements:

Requirement 1: Netlify Visual Editor Functionality: The solution *must* ensure that the Netlify Visual Editor is fully functional. This means the StackBlitz-like environment (currently Stackbit) must be correctly configured and working.

`Requirement 2: Correct dist Directory Contents:` The solution *must* ensure that the Vite build process correctly outputs *all* necessary website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, assets) into the `dist` directory. This is essential for successful Netlify deployments."

"We need a solution that allows the Netlify Visual Editor to work *in conjunction* with a correctly configured Vite build that produces the required `dist` directory output for Netlify deployments. Removing Stackbit is *not* an acceptable solution, as it will break the Visual Editor."

"Please provide a solution that addresses *both* of these requirements. We need the Netlify Visual Editor working *and* the `dist` directory populated correctly for Netlify deployments."

Constraints:

The Netlify Visual Editor must be functional.

The solution cannot involve removing Stackbit (or any component that provides its functionality).

The Vite build process must correctly output files to the dist directory.

Expected Outcome:

A solution that allows the user to use the Netlify Visual Editor while also deploying their site successfully on Netlify. This requires a configuration that correctly integrates Stackbit (or its equivalent) with the Vite build process.
